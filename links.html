                <p>
                    I started my data science journey here, at Kaggle. It's one of the best (if not the best) places to
                    find quality
                    and interesting datasets. They also have great tutorials showing the pipeline of a data science
                    project,
                    how to use the data science tools, and what makes a good data scientists. Once you finish your first
                    project, you can
                    share it on their platform to get critique as well as look at how other professionals would work on
                    the same
                    dataset you just did. If you're looking to get started in data science, Kaggle is a must.

                    One of my favorite resources to learn how the math behind various data science tools is StatQuest.
                    He takes hard to understand concepts like neural networks, probability theory, various machine
                    learning algorithms, and a lot more. It's vitally important to understand the math behind the
                    algorithms
                    you're using, so if you think you are lacking in that sense, this is a great place to start.

                <p>
                    If you've never programmed before Codeacademy is one of the best places to learn. The courses are
                    completely
                    free, besides the certificate you can get once you complete them. I did their courses around 8 years
                    ago while
                    I was in middle school; So if a 12 year old could understand them, I have no doubt you can to.

                    Medium is a jack of all trades kind of place. It has articles which cover the forefront of
                    everything you can think of.
                    The subsection Towards Data Science has all things data science. Towards AI contains the best of
                    tech, science, engineering,
                    and more. KDnuggets boasts all things machine learning, big data, analytics, and more. Not only does
                    it contain many up to
                    date articles, but also tutorials on how to use a lot of tools that wouldn't be found in other
                    places.

                    A lot of us don't have the time to read research papers or whole articles just to learn about a new
                    concept.
                    Sometimes, the only free time we have are the few minutes on our phone after we wake up. This is
                    where TLDR
                    comes in. TLDR is a daily email that consolidates all things tech, data science, and programming. I

                    This is one of my personal favorites. Whether you're in the car, out on a walk, or just hanging out
                    at home,
                    Chai Time Data Science is convenient data science knowledge. It was started by Sanyam Bhutani who
                    brings on
                    various important and prominent data science figures. From Kaggle's triple grandmaster to the
                    creators of Neo4j, you can expect to hear from some of the most interesting and intelligent data
                    scientists.
