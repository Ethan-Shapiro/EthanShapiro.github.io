                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p class="m-auto" style='width:90%' align="justify">
                    As someone who was looking for gaming data and specifically League of Legends data, this notebook (a
                    place to write code) above is one of the
                    first analysis you will find on Kaggle (a popular website to find data and analysis on it).
                    Since it is one of the first notebooks found, many new data scientists will look to this notebook
                    for guidance and
                    around League of Legends data; Therefore, I think it's important to reflect on prominent notebooks
                    to improve them
                    as well as notice what is done well.

                <h3>Notebook Overview</h3>
                <p class="m-auto" style='width:90%' align="justify">
                    That data itself is hosts various team statistics from 10,000 ranked League of Legends games, one of
                    which telling the team that won. The analysis attempts to answer the question "which features are
                    more correlated with
                    winning?" The author starts out with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where they explain
                    the various columns of data that they collected; This is done through various data visualizations.
                    Next, they clean the data by determining which columns leak information about each other and
                    removing one of them.
                    Finally, they implement various machine learning algorithms to use the data to predict which team
                    won.

                <h3>Positives</h3>
                <p class="m-auto" style='width:90%' align="justify">
                    Let's start with the good parts of this notebook (from the perspective of how I would have done it).
                    First of all, I liked the inclusion of an introduction; Whenever you make an analysis, especially a
                    public one,
                    it should have an introduction of the dataset. This functions to give anyone reading an
                    understanding of your
                    data so they can understand how you interpret it better later. Next is the cleaning section, which
                    shows a decent way of how to clean data for a model. Co-linearity is an important factor to look for
                    which
                    many new data scientists might not think of.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Negatives</h3>
                <p class="m-auto" style='width:90%' align="justify">
                    Now, for the parts that need improvement. While having the introduction was good, it was definitely lacking in
                    some aspects. First of all, there were no explanations of what each column meant. So while we knew where the 
                    data came from, we don't actually know what each column of the data means. Another item that was missing was the
                    explanation of what the notebook was actually doing. While I mentioned the research question earlier, the actual
                    notebook doesn't explain anywhere what features are more correlated with winning. To continue with the lack of
                    explanations, 
                </p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p class="m-auto" style='width:90%' align="justify">
                    That data itself is various team statistics from 10,000 ranked League of Legends games, one of which
                    telling the team that won. The author does an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), machine learning
                    prediction,
                    with the goal of answering the question "which features are more correlated with winning".
