                    <p>I would define myself as a tireless seeker of knowledge, occasional purveyor of wisdom and also,
                        coincidentally, a Data Scientist and Developer (or at least, I'm trying to be).
                        More importantly, I'm a second year Data Science major at UCSD working towards becoming the best
                        Data Scientist and Developer. I currently hold two positions: Esports Assistant at UCSD
                        Recreation and Data Science Tutor at the HalicioÄŸlu Data Science Institute. In these roles I'm
                        actively using major web technologies, data science essentials, and taking lead on various
                        projects. My dream is to own an esports analytics company, but until then, I'm always looking
                        for industry experience, so feel free to contact me with any opportunities!

                    <h4 style="text-align: center;">Why do I love what I do?</h4>
                    <p>Being an avid gamer for as long as I can remember, I would have never expected I would be
                        studying Data Science. Surely I would be a game developer, creating any game I imagined. So when
                        I stumbled upon Data Science, I was hesitant at first. I mean, who likes looking at numbers and
                        graphs day after day? But as I learned more about the power of data, I realized how closely
                        related my passion of games and data science truly are.
                        In my day to day life I started to realize how often we use data science without knowing.
                        Judging where a driver is intending to go, whether the price of the apple at the grocery store
                        is reasonable, if a player is going to dodge a certain way in a game; These are all data science
                        thinking in disguise. Knowing this allowed me to understand my new passion in two ways:
                        Programming and Data Science as my tools, but learning about people, understanding the world's
                        intricacies, and being able to create as my true passions.

                    <p>Since middle school, I've spent a lot of time on personal projects. One of those personal
                        projects is this page itself, which aims to showcase my expertise and understanding of the data
                        science and developer ecosystem. As much as I love coding, I like to be well rounded. You'll
                        often find me gymming, cooking, surfing, playing guitar,
                        singing, or many other things. However, even now, my favorite pastime is playing video games
                        with my friends. You'd think that even after sitting at
                        a computer coding all day I would want to leave. I realize I've made some of my best friends
                        playing video games, so why stop just because I'm "getting old".
